# Sequence Alignment Tool

## Overview

The Sequence Alignment Tool is a web application that allows users to input two sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) and align them using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment. The tool provides an intuitive interface to visualize the aligned sequences and their alignment score.

## Features

- Input two sequences for alignment
- Perform global sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
- Display aligned sequences and alignment score
- User-friendly web interface
